A few notes on the implementation:
	- The dataset is converted and restructured in `dataconvert.py`.
	- Implementation of the Neural Network is found in `network.py`.
	- The dataset is normalized and provided to the network in `dataset.py`.
	- The storage and retreivel of data found during tested is implemented
	  in `db.py`. The database require a file called config.ini in the
	  project root directory with the following:

	    	[mysql]
	        host = <host>
	        database = model_results
	        user = <db user>
	        password = <db password>

	- The complete learning process is taken care of in `main.py`. Please
	  see --help for options to be included.
	- The `evaluation.py` script consists of various functions and methods
	  used for evaluation purposes and generation of figures and tables to
	  the thesis. This file is not essential, and should only be used as a
	  reference.

Example of use:
	1. python dataconvert.py dataset.mat (to convert the dataset)
	2. python main.py --no-storage --region EONon (to train the ANN using
	   the EON (onshore) dataset and default network parameters)

	Note: The seasonal harmonics for the relevant timestamps must be placed
	in the file `harmonics/seasonal_harmonics.csv` before the model can be
	trained.
